Design notes / what to look for:

Centered header “splash” with a quick shimmer effect on load
Clean section layout with consistent spacing and typography
Project cards use CSS Grid (3 columns on desktop) and stack into 1 column on mobile
Hover/transition effects on cards to make the page feel a bit more interactive without being distracting

Tools / resources I used:

Google Fonts (Poppins + Space Grotesk): https://fonts.google.com/
Shimmer text idea : https://css-tricks.com/animating-with-clip-path/ 
CSS transitions/hover patterns: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition
CSS Grid for the project layout: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout

I was aiming for something that looks polished but still readable, please Let me know what you guys think!!
